![Supervised Agentic AI Platform](/media/supervised-agentic-ai-platform.png)

Supervised Agentic AI Platform is a platform that allows you to create and manage AI agents. It provides a set of tools and features to help you build, deploy, and monitor your AI agents. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

#### Human-in-the-loop

Supervised Agentic AI Platform is a human-in-the-loop platform that allows you to create and manage AI agents. It provides a set of tools and features to help you build, deploy, and monitor your AI agents. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

#### What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. The model learns to make predictions based on the input data and the corresponding output labels. In the context of GreyCollar, supervised learning is used to train AI agents to perform specific tasks based on the knowledge and responsibilities defined in the system.

### MCP

The platform is built on MCP protocol, which is a lightweight and efficient protocol for communication between AI agents. It allows for seamless data exchange and functionality between different agents and services.

### Event-drive Architecture

EDA is the key component of the platform. It allows for real-time communication and interaction between different agents and services. The event-driven architecture enables the platform to be highly scalable and flexible, allowing for easy integration with other applications and services.

### Reactive Functions

Nano-services inspired by reactive functions are the building blocks of the platform. They are small, self-contained functions that can be easily combined to create complex workflows and processes. The reactive functions are designed to be modular and reusable, allowing for easy integration with other services and applications.

### Communication

The platform provides a set of communication channels to interact with the AI agents. These channels include chat, email, and other forms of communication. The communication channels are designed to be user-friendly and accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## Entities

### Colleague (AI)

Colleague is the AI assistant that helps you with your tasks based on responsibilities and knowledge.

### Knowledge

Knowledge is the information that the AI uses to assist you. It can be in the form of documents, FAQs, or any other relevant data.

### Responsibility

Responsibility is blueprint of the tasks that the AI can perform. It defines what the AI can do and how it can assist you.

### Integration

Integrations are the connections between GreyCollar and other applications or services. They allow for seamless data exchange and functionality.

### Task/Step

Task is the action that the AI performs based on the knowledge and responsibility. It can be a simple task or a complex process.

### Supervising (Human)

Supervising is the process of monitoring and managing the AI's actions. It ensures that the AI is performing tasks correctly and efficiently.

### Communication

Communication is the interaction between the AI and the user. It can be in the form of messages, notifications, or any other means of communication.

### Team/TeamDetails

Team is the group of colleagues that work together to achieve a common goal. It can be a project team, department, or any other group of individuals.

### Session/Conversation

Session is the interaction between the user and the AI. It can be a chat, email, or any other form of communication.
