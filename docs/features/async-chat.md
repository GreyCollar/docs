Communicate effectively across time zones with our powerful async chat feature. Unlike real-time messaging, async chat allows users to leave messages that team members can respond to at their convenience. This feature is ideal for distributed teams working across different schedules.

Threads help organize discussions around specific topics or tasks, ensuring that important conversations are easy to follow. The platform also offers message pinning, tagging, and search functionality for easy access to essential information.

You can share files, links, and documents directly within chats, streamlining project collaboration. Notifications ensure that users stay informed about relevant updates, without the pressure of immediate response.
