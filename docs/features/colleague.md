Colleague is an AI assistant that performs tasks based on its responsibilities and knowledge. Each Colleague is embodied with human-like characteristics.

- **Name**: The name of the colleague.
- **Avatar**: The avatar of the colleague.
- **Title**: The title of the colleague.
- **Character**: The character of the colleague, which defines how the colleague interacts with users.
- **Role**: The role of the colleague, which defines its position and guides how it completes tasks.

## AI Engine

Each colleague can be run on different AI engines, which can be configured in the settings. So, even in the same team, different colleagues can use different AI engines.

> :warning: Even though colleagues share the same knowledge base, the platform manages embeddings for each AI engine, so that the AI engine can use the knowledge base effectively.
